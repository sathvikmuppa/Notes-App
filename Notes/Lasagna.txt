Ingredients:
9 lasagna noodles
1 pound (450g) ground beef
1 onion, diced
3 cloves of garlic, minced
1 can (14 ounces) crushed tomatoes
1 can (6 ounces) tomato paste
1 tablespoon dried basil
1 tablespoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 cups ricotta cheese
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1 egg, lightly beaten

Instructions:
Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.
In a large skillet, brown the ground beef over medium heat until fully cooked. Add the diced onion and minced garlic, and cook for another 2-3 minutes until the onion is translucent.
Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper. Simmer the sauce for about 10 minutes, then remove from heat.
In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, chopped parsley, and beaten egg. Mix well.
To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Place three lasagna noodles over the sauce, followed by a layer of the meat sauce, a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture, and a sprinkle of shredded mozzarella cheese. Repeat the layers, ending with a final layer of meat sauce and shredded mozzarella cheese on top.
Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.
Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes until the cheese is bubbly and golden.
Allow the lasagna to cool for a few minutes before serving. Slice into portions and enjoy!
